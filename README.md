## Description
This project is a short interactive story built with p5.js and organized into game states. The user sees a foggy scene and a UI panel with narrative text and choices. Each choice adjusts a Trust stat that determines the ending. The design is inspired by choose‑your‑own‑adventure stories and the tension of deciding who to trust.

## Interaction Instructions
- Click “Begin the walk” or press Space to start.
- Click the on‑screen choice buttons to advance the story.
- Trust increases or decreases with each choice.
- After the final beat, high Trust unlocks the win ending; lower Trust unlocks the lose ending.
