## Description
This project is a short interactive story built with p5.js and organized into game states. The user sees a foggy scene and a UI panel with narrative text and choices. Each choice adjusts three stats — Trust, Health, and Energy — which determines the ending. The design is inspired by choose‑your‑own‑adventure stories and the tension of deciding who to trust while managing limited resources.

## Interaction Instructions
- Click “Begin the walk” or press Space to start.
- Click the on‑screen choice buttons to advance the story.
- Trust, Health, and Energy update after each choice (with small random ranges).
- After the final beat, a high Trust score plus surviving Health/Energy unlocks the win ending; otherwise the lose ending appears.
